## The Exploratory Data Analysis on the IPL dataset                                                                                     
1.Conducted in-depth analysis of the IPL dataset (a large dataset of over 200,000 rows) to uncover trends and patterns related to team performance, player statistics, match outcomes, etc.
2.Utilized Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.
3.Created visualizations (e.g., bar plots, heatmaps, histograms) to present findings on player performance and match trends.
4.Used machine learning techniques (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest) to build and evaluate the win probability predictor, achieving a competitive accuracy.
